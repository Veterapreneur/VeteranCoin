# VeteranCoin  ™
Ethereum ERC20 token and crowd sale code from Veterapreneur.io


Veterapreneur operates on the Ethereum blockchain. By adopting an existing blockchain infrastructure with a valuable currency and vibrant development community we take advantage of well adopted technology while adding only the specific functionality to support our goals. In addition, we increase the likelihood of early adoption within both the Veteran and Ethereum communities. We will be launching a crypto token for use in the Veterapreneur ecosystem. The Veterapreneur token is called VeteranCoin; VeteranCoin provides access to rewards via the Veterapreneur platform and will be available for trading on the open market. Our customer companies and nonprofits will raise a fixed % of their crowdfunded revenue in VeteranCoin using our platform and the coin markets.

The initial supply of VeteranCoin will be limited to 100M tokens. Only 75% of the total supply will be available during the token swap as described in the whitepaper paper, what isn't sold at the token swap will be destroyed and the volume sold becomes the new maximum supply. The 25% not made available during the token swap will be used over the course of ongoing company operations and for bounties. In combination, this makes VeteranCoin one of the lowest token supplies of any blockchain start-up in 2017. In addition, participation in Veterapreneur platform will require significant use of the VeteranCoin as it will be the preferred method of exchange. VeteranCoins will be destructively scavenged through swap-backs funded using 50% of all corporate profits in an immediate and continual process (smart contract) when company operations commence.

Additionally we will work with outside vendors to obtain services and products for our token holders. We will offer access to the buying power of our members in exchange for promotions from vendors. This makes the Veterapreneur token an exclusive “price club” or “permanent groupon” to attract b2b funds through advertising and special promotions to holders. The value from these discounted products and services for token holders should be conservatively estimated at 10X-20X the initial token value at ICO (for single token promotions) and somewhere between $1500.00 to $2500.00 US dollars annually with number of promotions increasing over time. For volume token promotions (% of token market) the value should represent significantly more, on par with exclusive opportunities found for high net worth individuals in credit offerings (Mastercard, Visa).
